### Documentation

- `README.md` - Project overview
- `QUICK_START.md` - 5-minute setup guide
- `USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Detailed instructions
- `MODELS.md` - Complete model list
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Contribution guidelines
- `INDEX.md` - Documentation index

### Configuration

- `.env.example` - API key configuration template
- `config.example.yaml` - System configuration template
- `.gitignore` - Proper excludes for logs/results/models

### CI/CD

- GitHub Actions workflow for testing
- Issue templates (bug reports, feature requests)
- Pull request template
- Automated import testing

### Known Limitations

1. **Local Models**: Require significant RAM (~8GB for 7B models)
2. **API Costs**: Full benchmark can cost $30-100 depending on model
3. **Mac vLLM**: Not supported - use Transformers instead
4. **Network**: Required for API-based models

### Migration Notes

**From Development to Release:**
- Removed personal API keys and logs
- Excluded downloaded models from distribution
- Added example configuration files
- Created clean directory structure

### Security

- ✅ No hardcoded API keys
- ✅ Environment variable based configuration
- ✅ `.gitignore` for sensitive data
- ✅ Example files for safe sharing

### Future Roadmap

- [ ] MLX support for Apple Silicon
- [ ] Additional Turkish language tests
- [ ] Web interface for results
- [ ] Caching for repeated tests
- [ ] Multi-language support framework
